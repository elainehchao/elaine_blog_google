            I have been thinking about blogging for several years now, but there was never enough time. There was never really enough time for me to do anything. After a long day at work or school, how could I make time to blog when there was so much TV to watch? My brain was just so tired from all my hard work, a lazy night was justified. Of course that's not true. Although it sounds cheesy, you can do anything you set your mind to. That is, after all, how I got to season 3 of Empire in just a few weeks.
            <br><br>


            The list of things I have tried and not followed through on is embarrassingly long, and I feel like that has defined who I am. The way I see it, there are 2 possible reasons for why I'm like this: I'm lazy. Or I haven't found anything I enjoy enough yet. Well no more~ the old me was all talk with the things I want to do. It's time to start following through.

            Speaking of season 3 of Empire..definitely one of those shows that I'm into for the unrealistic, soap opera-y, never-going-to-happen-in-my-life type drama that happens in every 10 minutes of the show. Besides that, the music is so catchy, and the characters are surprisingly relatable. Found myself tearing up more than once.
