            This past weekend I went to the state fair with Harshith and Rachael. It was father's day Sunday so I also convinced my mom and stepdad to come too. To be honest we didn't really go to just go to the fair. We went for the beer.
            <br><br>

            Every year the <a class="post_link" href="https://sandiegobeerfestival.com/">San Diego International Beer Festival</a> is held at the Del Mar fairgrounds at the same time as the fair. Your beer festival ticket also counts as your fair admission, so in my opinion it's a pretty good deal. The festival lets you choose between a VIP ticket or just a regular ticket. Unless you're trying to be extra, the regular ticket is definitely sufficient at about half the price. Harshith and I got another ~$10 discount by getting our tickets through Groupon. If you're trying to do that though you gotta plan ahead because they sell out as the event gets closer. Your ticket comes with admission to the fair (as I said) and a small souvenir cup where the volunteers will pour you 1 ounce servings of unlimited beer. I was actually a fan of the serving size - it let me taste a large variety of beer while maintaining a comfortable buzz. I also thought it was nice that you don't need to have a ticket to walk around the festival. So my mom, who doesn't drink beer, was able to walk around with us as well. She's just not supposed to drink anything (but who's watching?). There are also a few vendors on site selling some delicious stone oven pizzas and other interesting beer related products. This was my second International Beer Festival attendance, and it was just as fun as last year. We also happened to catch one of the scheduled beer and chocolate tastings. Basically super sweet chocolate making bitter beer taste amazing. <i class="post_italic">Reminder for my next beer festival: pretzel necklaces</i>.

            I duno what it is about fairs that are so enticing. People flock to these things, cash in hand ready to give up $$$ for a chance to toss rings on bottles and win rasta bananas. Well I'm one of them haha. I just want someone to win me a giant stuffed Sriracha bottle! A must have for a Sriracha fan such as myself. Also..turkey legs. I always get them and they always come out a little too dry, too much turkey, and too much $$$. Nobody is ever as enthusiastic about the giant turkey leg as I am, too. I think for good reason. So to all my friends who have begrudgingly shared a turkey leg with me: thank you.

            Another plus of the fair are the rides. Unfortunately, we spent a good deal of time riding rides in the kiddy section before realizing that there was a whole other adult ride section where the REAL rides are. By that point I was pretty exhausted though. Rachael pulled through though - definitely the ride winner of the day. Although I really would have loved to ride the REAL ferris wheel, I think the view from the kiddy ferris wheel was pretty solid. Honestly I was also just grateful to sit down. By the end of the day my apple watch said I had walked 14,243 steps (~6 miles), but my feet were more tired than when I ran my half marathon last year.
            <br><br>


            On our way back to the fair exit, we walked by fair stands in exhaustion and mild-medium disgust at the posters of donut burgers and bacon covered everything that surrounded us. That funnel cake, though, smelled soo good. Who eats this stuff? I guess that's one of the allures of state fairs. A mass congregation of gastronomical sins, all of which you are forgiven once you step off the fair grounds.

            Overall, a really great day. But I was happy to come home, have my Chicken Burrito Bowl from Chipotle and watch the next episode of Survivor 2nd Chance with baeee.
